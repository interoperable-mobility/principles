Currently, transportation technology companies have built proprietary ways of representing information that likely are similar to, but slightly different from, those used by other companies. In order to communicate with any other device, their applications have to be programmed, generally at additional expense, to understand one another. In many cases, this additional expense or hassle is replaced with countless staff hours doing double- and in some cases triple data-entry. The common results in either case are:</p> <ul> <li>Transit agencies and other mobility service providers encountering an extreme amount of friction in order to manage and operate service (especially changes to the service),</li> <li>Transportation system managers being unable to understand the full picture of the system in a consistent and up-to-date manner,</li> <li>Transit agencies and other mobility service providers experiencing difficulty accessing, validating, and aggregating the information they need to assess how the system they fund actually functions, and</li> <li>Extreme friction in time and cost in updating and upgrading any technology component to meet new requirements or take advantage of additional innovations.</li> <li>Travelers receiving information that is not reliable, diminishing their trust in mobility service providers.</li> </ul> <p>The high friction thus results in a technology marketplace where there are minimal incentives for:</p> <ul> <li>Incumbent transit technology providers to increase interoperability or innovate high-quality products and service, and</li> <li>Additional transit technology providers to enter the market.</li> </ul> <p>The current lack of interoperability restricts all mobility stakeholders from performing to the best of their ability. The result is often a poor customer experience, hampered innovation, and frustration for all parties. The broader impact for the transit industry is a reduction in the attractiveness of transit systems, which limits overall ridership growth. This is a grave loss to a society in which greater transit utilization is necessary for improving social and economic equity and environmental sustainability.</p> <p>An interoperable mobility industry would improve service quality and efficiency. Interoperability would also promote the ability of the transit providers and other mobility service providers to adapt to continuing changes in the mobility landscape, to more effectively plan service, and to spur innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs. In other words, interoperability will support more cost-effective solutions for the generation and application of mobility data. This improved cost-effectiveness will conserve public dollars and promote the equitable distribution of benefits across both larger and smaller, better funded and cash-strapped transit systems.</p> <p>Interoperability is also the only way to progressively build the mobility ecosystems in a given area, allowing it to integrate, new modes, new partners (public or private) and new systems. It provides the ability to scale quickly. Another key aspect of interoperability is to insure that the local knowledge is always coming AND transferred back to the Transit agencies (when transportation technology companies compute full/part of the data) AND the Transportation system managers to ensure its reliability.</p>"},{"location":"about/#how-do-these-principles-support-interoperability","title":"How do these principles support interoperability?","text":"<p>The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will help the transit industry and other mobility service providers move toward interoperability by encouraging the adoption and implementation of adopted and proposed open standards originating within the industry itself.

OSM\u2019s standard file format and API data format is XML, which isn\u2019t listed in this doc. OSM data is licensed under a \u201cviral\u201d license, some would argue doesn\u2019t fit the goals of \u201copenness\u201d in these principles \u2014 then again, others would argue it does. Also debatable is whether OSM has \u201ctransparent, inclusive governance.\u201d Much progress related to OSM actually happens outside of the OSM Foundation and its communication channels. We don\u2019t want to be \u201cdowners,\u201d but OSM is very mixed as a role model for other projects.</p> Response <p>MDIP agrees that OSM is not easily citable as an open technology.</p> Action <p>Modifications made</p> <p>OSM removed from examples</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Steve White, GMV Syncromatics</p> <p>Re: Ability of Interoperability to enable MSPs to swap GPS units or onboard computers: This sounds nice in theory, but the fact of the matter is that the onboard unit used by a CAD/AVL system is more than just a \u201cGPS unit\u201d and these things are not going to be widely interchangeable even if they use commercial off the shelf hardware. An agency cannot simply swap out \u201cGPS units,\u201d because the GPS functionality is included in a tablet or computer-type piece of hardware that performs many other functions. Some companies develop their products on Android and some on Linux (both open source operating systems), and some use Windows or other type devices. I don\u2019t assume the interoperability principles would go so far as to define a specific OS or hardware architecture, so this entire point feels far-fetched to me. Only in the most basic GPS-only type deployments could it be possible \u2013 where multiple routers or single-purpose GPS trackers would use a TAIP or NMEA type standard. All of the other points in this section make sense.</p> Response <p>The language used here (\u201cInteroperability enables: Mobility service providers to easily change which GPS unit their CAD/AVL system uses because the old and new GPS units transmit data in an open standard and the CAD/AVL system ingests data in an open standard.\u201d) is or should be more directly focused on the intention of the co-authors to combat so-called vendor lock-in and the inability of Mobility Service Providers to secure the technology they want to use. The intention of this bullet point is not to suggest that interoperability means that a specific fine-grained technology will be able to work with another within a single vendor\u2019s suite of components necessarily (although the Principles might provide an incentive in that direction). In general, this point should be broadened so that it is about the expectation that interoperability will allow for MSPs to \u201cright-size\u201d their Mobility Technology Components to meet their existing and projected needs because those components will be better integrated into a larger Mobility Technology System.</p> Action <p>Modificaitons Made</p> <p>Replace existing language with:  </p> <p>Mobility service providers to more easily receive the mobility technology components that meet the needs of their uses because components are better integrated into a larger mobility technology system, in which the transmission and ingestion of data is utilizing open standards.\u201d</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"public_draft_review/#additional-responses-to-public-review-comments","title":"Additional Responses to Public Review Comments","text":"Concern <p>Chloe Spano, Cityway</p> <p>How does MDIP result in ability of mobility service providers to use data from other MSPs? Through collaborative 1-to-1 agreements?</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>The statement in the MDIP vision (\u201cMobility service providers can\u2026 Easily use their data and data from other mobility providers to increase rider satisfaction and the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality.\u201d) references the ability of data to be more widely available to various consumers in an interconnected network of service provision. It is anticipated that interoperability will result in a fuller picture of mobility data for all providers without the need for private one-on-one agreements between operators.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Chloe Spano, Cityway</p> <p>Under implementation responsibilities: Transit Agencies and Governments should allow access keys to data consumers</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>This comment is posted in multiple locations in response to the use of the phrase \u201cwithout restriction\u201d to the access of data in open standard or proposed open standard format. The intention of MDIP is that access keys would constitute an acceptable means of making data available to parties designated by the transit agency or mobility service provider.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Chloe Spano, Cityway</p> <p>Change definition of published data so that data published via documented API \u201cmust\u201d (rather than \u201cmay\u201d) be granted via API key.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>The impact of this change is that MDIP would not consider data to be published if the API operator were to make the data available without an API key. MDIP is allowing for but not mandating the use of API keys, and the default in some cases might well be for there to be no API key, which appears to be an acceptable use.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Steve Yaffe, Yaffe Mobility Consulting</p> <p>The definition of Mobility Technology Component is key and should be highlighted up front, as this defines which categories of data fields are necessary for interoperability - to efficiently provide inter-modal and/or multi-provider linked trips. The 6<sup>th</sup> category, \u201cManage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)\u201d, is too broad. Performance Reporting is germane. Each mobility provider\u2019s internal processes, including shift selection and non-revenue schedules, are not germane. Internal processes should be explicitly excluded from this effort. This revision will encourage participation by the private sector. The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> categories should be more explicit and combined: \u201cFacilitate communications and processes among the staff involved in providing rides (drivers, schedulers, dispatch and other on-board staff) involved in booking, assigning, providing and monitoring rides through hardware, software and protocols\u201d. While older systems separate the scheduling, trip assignment, dispatch, and monitoring processes, these are combined by the newer dynamic real-time ride providers.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>In the published format we anticipate making the definitions easily available throughout the document using tooltips and/or links. The definition should be evident to readers from the first mention.  Internal processes are not excluded from MDIP due to the desire through interoperability to help identify and eliminate existing gaps in the flow of data for mobility consumers/producers. Generally, there is not industrywide agreement on what constitutes internal processes and making a decision to exclude them here could result in a significant reduction in MDIP\u2019s ability to press the industry toward interoperability. Additionally, some MDIP coauthors are presently working with industry partners to standardize data for non-revenue services and shift selection.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Anat Caspi, Taskar Center for Accessible Technology</p> <p>I would very much like to see (and contribute to) implementation stories, as well as the production of presentation materials that would allow for dissemination of the principles. Specifically, it would be great to take after the model of Smart Growth America, develop the principles a little bit more, and offer advocates of the principles a coherent set of slides and instructional material from/through which they can evangelize the ideas in the principles.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>This comment relates specifically to implementation of the principles and not to the document, however it seems like a good course of action for MDIP as we move into the post-v1-publication phase of promoting the principles.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Weston Shippy,Trillium Transit</p> <p>Happy with the product overall! The principles mention end users and mobility service providers as stakeholders who can benefit from interoperable data, but they don\u2019t mention planning/regulatory/DOTs or academic researchers. This omission may have been intentional, however, because they were discussed in the drafting process.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>Planning/regulatory/DOTs are contemplated by the MDIP as being part of Transportation System Managers. Researchers are listed as an independent (albeit undefined) stakeholder in the Vision statement.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Sean Holman</p> <p>I believe that the development of open standards and open source tools is critical to the future of mobility. These principles embody the strength that comes from an aligned approach amongst complimentary projects like MDS, GBFS, and GTFS</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>Comment is supportive of the project.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Jamie M. Fischer</p> <ul> <li>The vision for transit operators and the discussion of interoperability\u2019s importance should include a reference to data validation, quality control, and cross-referencing.  </li> <li>The vision for transit system managers should make reference to project selection and funding to meet emerging customer needs.  </li> </ul> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>The language that has been selected for MDIP v1 is generally \u201cbest available\u201d and in \u201creal-time.\u201d The implementation responsibilities language has more expressive force where quality and validation are concerned. This may be an area to revisit in a future document, but for the time being validation and quality are viewed as areas of enforcement, rather than natural outgrowths of MDIP.</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Jamie M. Fischer</p> <p>Re: read/write access requirement in Implementation Responsibilities: Is this reasonable for all transportation technology components? I imagine read-only access would be an easier sell - specifically because of the \u201cfree from cost\u201d detail. Write-access might require contractual relationships, unless I\u2019m not understanding the responsibility as written.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>The stipulation may be overbroad given the broad construction of transportation technology components, resulting in a higher than desired implementation cost. | Language changed from \u201cread/write\u201d to \u201cread-only or read/write.\u201d The default assumption will therefore be read-only</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Drew Dara-Abrams, Interline</p> <p>Re: Open Standards. The criteria will likely clash with approaches taken by some other orgs \u2014 SAE and the Alliance for Parking Data Standards come to mind. Maybe that is inevitable, but do consider reaching out to discuss</p> Response <p>Future Action</p> <p>MDIP will coordinate and communicate with SAE, ADPS, CEN and APTA</p> <p></p> Concern <p>Steve White, GMV Syncromatics</p> <p>Regarding Implementation Responsibilities to support \u201cadopted and proposed open standards\u201d: My only comment here is that the \u201cproposed\u201d language should be removed. Until a standard is accepted and implemented by other parties, it\u2019s unlikely that even a vendor who is generally agreeable to open standards will start implementing it in hopes that it becomes widely adopted. I realize this is a bit of a catch-22, as the lack of critical mass adoption prevents a critical mass from agreeing to adopt a standard, but few companies will want to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d standards until they see adoption. A good example of this is GTFS-ride for sharing historical APC data. We see the benefit of it, the standard is current, but adoption is so low that it makes no sense for us to invest in adopting it ourselves. Until scheduling providers that have customers in common with us actually adopt it, there is no reason for us to do so and our time is better spent on other endeavors. With that in mind, it would be difficult for us to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d open standards. We would certainly commit to language that says we\u2019d utilize \u201cwidely adopted\u201d or \u201cindustry accepted\u201d open standards. This \u201cadopted\u201d language makes sense especially when you follow to the next sections in the document which say that transportation technology companies shall \u201ccollaboratively develop and adopt open standards where gaps currently exist.\u201d That is agreeable, because it comes with the assumption that other companies would adopt those standards, thus it becomes worth everyone\u2019s time to adopt and no single company would be left as the only one having wasted time adopting a standard that no other companies adopted.</p> Response <p>Noted</p> <p>The implementation responsibilities are the main enforcement backstop for the principles that prevent them from being merely aspirational. They are intended to serve as a benchmark against which the co-authors, prospective buyers, MSPs, communities, and other interested stakeholders can assess whether or not a given mobility technology component is or isn\u2019t interoperability compliant.  This topic came up in Admin Review conversations and among co-authors who determined that it was reasonable to establish some definition for \u201cproposed open standard\u201d that has a higher threshold than merely existing, including the transition of the standard to an independent group for management.</p>"},{"location":"public_draft_review/#public-draft-reviewers","title":"Public Draft Reviewers","text":"<p>In addition to the co-authors and co-signatories, the public draft was distributed to a multitude of interested public-sector, public-interest, academic, and private-sector organizations and individuals.

The meeting was opened with a reading of the proposed revisions to the Vision statement and Principle 5.

Data Interoperability Principles (MDIP). MDIP is an ambitious effort to accelerate the implementation, adoption, and creation of open standards for mobility data by bringing together these groups:</p> <ul> <li>mobility service providers (transit agencies and other companies who provide rides),  </li> <li>transportation technology companies (software or hardware vendors),research institutions,  </li> <li>transportation system managers (DOTs and other regulators of transportation infrastructure), and  </li> <li>the public.  </li> </ul> <p>You can now watch the full meeting here.</p> <p>The session was designed to provide answers to common questions that the co-authors have received about MDIP and to give an opportunity for additional discussion about near-term actions that can be taken to achieve the vision laid out in MDIP. Regardless if you are already among the co-signers or if this is your first time hearing about the project, this session will help you figure out where you fit in to MDIP.</p> <p>Attendees will gain a better understanding of:</p> <ul> <li>The objectives that MDIP is seeking to achieve,  </li> <li>Why MDIP is the right tool to achieve our objectives,  </li> <li>What practical steps co-signers should expect to take in support of MDIP, and  </li> <li>What resources are (or will be) available to co-signers to help us all succeed together.</li> </ul> <p>The session is about 90 minutes.  </p> <p>If you have any questions about the event, please contact Scott Frazier at scott@compiler.la.</p>"},{"location":"vision/","title":"Our Vision for an Interoperable Transit Industry","text":"<p>More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit providers and transportation technology companies.</p> <p>All people can, equitably:  </p> <ul> <li>Discover and make informed choices about their mobility options in scheduled and/or real-time by utilizing the highest possible quality of information with the least possible barriers to accessing that information;
