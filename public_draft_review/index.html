<blockquote>
<p>The definition of Mobility Technology Component is key and should be highlighted up front, as this defines which categories of data fields are necessary for <abbr title="The ability for any mobility technology component to exchange data in an open standard or schema with other components in that system.">interoperability</abbr> - to efficiently provide inter-modal and/or multi-provider linked trips.<br />
<br>
The 6<sup>th</sup> category, &ldquo;Manage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)&rdquo;, is too broad.<br />
Performance Reporting is germane.<br />
Each mobility provider&rsquo;s internal processes, including shift selection and non-revenue schedules, are not germane.<br />
<br>
Internal processes should be explicitly excluded from this effort.  This revision will encourage participation by the private sector.<br />
<br>
The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> categories should be more explicit and combined: &ldquo;Facilitate communications and processes among the staff involved in providing rides (drivers, schedulers, dispatch and other on-board staff) involved in booking, assigning, providing and monitoring rides through hardware, software and protocols&rdquo;.<br />
<br>
While older systems separate the scheduling, trip assignment, dispatch, and monitoring processes, these are combined by the newer dynamic real-time ride providers.</p>

<p>Planning, modeling, and analysis are included in the scope of the Principles, but <em>only to the extent that they are functions of an established stakeholder</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the Principles take into account the transit planning that takes place in the development of new schedules for an agency. There may likewise be modeling and analysis that is utilized to assess actual performance or the performance of potential alternatives. However, the <em>Principles do not at this stage include long-term planning activities like construction of new transportation facilities, nor does it include traffic volume analyses, traffic light analyses, or any modeling related to these.</em></p>
<p>These items were excluded from scope due to the feedback received during the Admin review period for the Principles, that a too-broad scope would significantly increase implementation challenges. Such items may be scoped in for a future version of the Principles.</p>

<p>After several meetings, the co-authors concluded that equity was more properly an initial motivating factor for the Principles themselves. Equity and sustainability were thus added to the Purpose statement within the document. Additionally, in order to reduce the perceived individualism of elevating travelers but not groups of people to the level of stakeholders, the group determined that the language should include a reference to the public at large as being stakeholders.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Benjie de la Pena, SUMC</p>
<p>SUMC suggests including community as key stakeholder of the Interoperability Principles. The current draft only considers transit agencies, mobility service providers, and individuals. The communities are not even contemplated. We suggest appending a sentence to the 5<sup>th</sup> principle or (our preference) adding a sixth principle.  </p>
<p>Option A Principle #5.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Equity</p>
<p>MDIP co-authors discussed equity as a component of the vision for this document. It was agreed on that communities are a stakeholder for the Interoperability Principles. Concern was expressed regarding the appropriate way to bring equity into the principles. Concern was expressed that in not mentioning equity, MDIP would lose meaningful mechanism to hold signers to pursuit of equity outcomes later on.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Anti-discrimination</p>
<p>In regards to the issue of anti-discrimination, that is (sort of) addressed in the implementation responsibilities’s reliance on open standards which should be usable/consumable by any developer or app. That being said, there is a certain level of gatekeeping built in to MDIP at this point because discretion as to what information should be distributed and to whom is ultimately given to the Mobility Service Provider.

<p>OpenStreetMap is a complicated example to cite. OSM’s standard file format and API data format is XML, which isn’t listed in this doc. OSM data is licensed under a “viral” license, some would argue doesn’t fit the goals of “openness” in these principles — then again, others would argue it does. Also debatable is whether OSM has “transparent, inclusive governance.” Much progress related to OSM actually happens outside of the OSM Foundation and its communication channels. We don’t want to be “downers,” but OSM is very mixed as a role model for other projects.</p>

<p>Re: Ability of Interoperability to enable MSPs to swap GPS units or onboard computers: This sounds nice in theory, but the fact of the matter is that the onboard unit used by a CAD/AVL system is more than just a “GPS unit” and these things are not going to be widely interchangeable even if they use commercial off the shelf hardware. An agency cannot simply swap out “GPS units,” because the GPS functionality is included in a tablet or computer-type piece of hardware that performs many other functions. Some companies develop their products on Android and some on Linux (both open source operating systems), and some use Windows or other type devices. I don’t assume the <abbr title="The ability for any mobility technology component to exchange data in an open standard or schema with other components in that system.">interoperability</abbr> principles would go so far as to define a specific OS or hardware architecture, so this entire point feels far-fetched to me. Only in the most basic GPS-only type deployments could it be possible – where multiple routers or single-purpose GPS trackers would use a TAIP or NMEA type standard.<br />
All of the other points in this section make sense.</p>

<p>The definition of Mobility Technology Component is key and should be highlighted up front, as this defines which categories of data fields are necessary for <abbr title="The ability for any mobility technology component to exchange data in an open standard or schema with other components in that system.">interoperability</abbr> - to efficiently provide inter-modal and/or multi-provider linked trips. The 6<sup>th</sup> category, &ldquo;Manage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)&rdquo;, is too broad. Performance Reporting is germane. Each mobility provider&rsquo;s internal processes, including shift selection and non-revenue schedules, are not germane. Internal processes should be explicitly excluded from this effort. This revision will encourage participation by the private sector. The 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> categories should be more explicit and combined: &ldquo;Facilitate communications and processes among the staff involved in providing rides (drivers, schedulers, dispatch and other on-board staff) involved in booking, assigning, providing and monitoring rides through hardware, software and protocols&rdquo;.

<p>The language that has been selected for MDIP v1 is generally “best available” and in “real-time.” The implementation responsibilities language has more expressive force where quality and validation are concerned.

<p>Regarding Implementation Responsibilities to support “adopted and proposed open standards”: My only comment here is that the “proposed” language should be removed. Until a standard is accepted and implemented by other parties, it’s unlikely that even a vendor who is generally agreeable to open standards will start implementing it in hopes that it becomes widely adopted. I realize this is a bit of a catch-22, as the lack of critical mass adoption prevents a critical mass from agreeing to adopt a standard, but few companies will want to commit to adopting “proposed” standards until they see adoption. A good example of this is GTFS-ride for sharing historical APC data. We see the benefit of it, the standard is current, but adoption is so low that it makes no sense for us to invest in adopting it ourselves. Until scheduling providers that have customers in common with us actually adopt it, there is no reason for us to do so and our time is better spent on other endeavors. With that in mind, it would be difficult for us to commit to adopting “proposed” open standards. We would certainly commit to language that says we’d utilize “widely adopted” or “industry accepted” open standards. This “adopted” language makes sense especially when you follow to the next sections in the document which say that transportation technology companies shall “collaboratively develop and adopt open standards where gaps currently exist.” That is agreeable, because it comes with the assumption that other companies would adopt those standards, thus it becomes worth everyone’s time to adopt and no single company would be left as the only one having wasted time adopting a standard that no other companies adopted.</p>

<p>The implementation responsibilities are the main enforcement backstop for the principles that prevent them from being merely aspirational.

<p>During the Public Review period, organizations were allowed to express interest in joining the co-authors of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles before the publication of v1.</p>
<p>On September 27, 2021, the co-authors met to establish a formal process for admitting new co-authors and to vote on applications for co-author status by four organizations.</p>
<p>The co-authors expressed concern about the potential reputational impact on the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles that could be incurred if for-profit companies were allowed to join as co-authors. Additional concerns were raised including the potential for co-authors to have to pick winners and losers among for-profit applicants, the enforcement of the spirit of the principles, and the ability for the principles to be used primarily as a marketing tool by co-authors.</p>
<p>The co-authors decided that the marginal benefit to elevating for-profit companies as co-authors rather than as co-signatories was smaller than the marginal cost of allowing for-profit companies to join the ranks of the co-authors of the Principles.</p>
<p>Consequently, the co-authors have agreed upon the following process for the inclusion of new co-authors:</p>
<ol>
<li>New co-authors shall be accepted by application during an open call prior to the release of each version of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles.  </li>
<li>Co-authors must be institutions, transit agencies, or other non-profit organizations. Applications will not be accepted from for-profit companies, nor shall such companies be considered eligible to apply.  </li>
<li>Upon receipt of an application from an eligible organization, the co-authors will schedule a vote on the question of admitting the organization as a co-author.  </li>
<li>The initial question will be one of unanimous consent: if there are no objections to the admission of the applicant organization, the co-authors will formally move to accept the applicant organization as a co-author.  </li>
<li>If there are objections, they will be stated and discussed.  </li>
<li>If the question of admitting the applicant organization should be called again following the discussion of objections, the applicant organization may be admitted with a majority (50%+1 vote) of all co-authors voting in favor.  </li>
</ol>
<p>With this process established, consideration was taken up for the four applicant organizations for co-authorship under the new process prior to the release of v1. Of those organizations, three were for-profit firms (Cityway, Cubic, and Transit App) and thus ineligible under the new guidelines. These organizations will be notified of the policy and that their applications have therefore not been accepted. The fourth organization, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at University of Washington, was found to be eligible and was admitted as a co-author of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles without objection.</p>

Additionally, concerns were raised in the objections about the proposed revision to the Vision statement, in particular that they did not address sustainability directly.</p>
<p>On October 5, 2021, the Co-Author group was invited to a meeting to discuss the resolution of the outstanding objections and to develop new proposed revisions to address the Public Review comments. The meeting was opened with a reading of the proposed revisions to the Vision statement and Principle 5. Benjie de la Peña/SUMC presented his objections to the group, and stated that the main desires were the addition of a sixth principle to represent community empowerment and to move equity and sustainability from the Vision statement to the Purpose statement.</p>
<p>The Co-Author group discussed concerns around adding a sixth principle for communities, particularly that there was not a clear nexus between the Interoperability Principles - which are intended to facilitate the movement of data between actors in a closed system, rather than to serve as an open data project - and community empowerment. Concerns were also raised about the self-defining nature of Communities - which to this point has not been a defined term within the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles.</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised with the ability of the Co-Authors to serve as experts in the achievement of equity for communities, and with the potential for co-signatories to use the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles to “equity-wash” without meaningful implementation responsibilities. The group discussed potential equity-oriented implementation responsibilities, including a requirement for co-signatories to provide an appeals process, context, and justification for the creation of data types.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the group came to an agreement that despite concerns around individualism, there wasn’t a clear enough link between Interoperability Principles and community empowerment, or between community empowerment and equity, for inclusion at the Principle level in this document. Additionally, implementation responsibilities were not edited due in part to concerns about who the “do-er” would be and the potential for additional requirements to affect existing commitments from co-signatories.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded with the Co-Authors moving without objection to present the following changes to the full Co-Author group (Edits in bold):</p>
<ul>
<li>Amend the Purpose statement to read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles is to foster a transit industry where <abbr title="Data used by any mobility technology component to execute its core functions.">mobility data</abbr> flows freely and securely between systems, between operators, and between providers and the riding public, empowering transit agencies and other mobility service providers and transportation system managers to provide better service, improve the customer experience, <strong>and promoting equity and sustainability.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Amend Principle 5 to read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>All individuals <strong>and members of the public</strong> should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed <abbr title="Data used by any mobility technology component to execute its core functions.">mobility data</abbr> to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
